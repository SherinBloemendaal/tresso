/**
 * Sends one notification to every target of a user on the chosen channels: each enabled device whose channel is
 * chosen (Expo for the phone, web push and the desktop app for the desktop) and the notification email address.
 *
 * First every target is claimed with a delivery row for the delivery key, in the caller's transaction (so a
 * notification marked delivered always has its rows, and a crash before the sends leaves them to be retried) or in
 * one of its own. A target sent to before is skipped, so a retried message never notifies anyone twice; a target
 * whose send failed is claimed again after a pause that doubles with each attempt (up to MAX_ATTEMPTS), and one whose
 * send never reported back (a crash) after STUCK. A retry claims only the targets of the first delivery, not devices
 * registered since. Then the sends, outside any transaction, and their outcome. A device whose push service forgot
 * it is removed, at once or when Expo's receipt says so. The desktop app shows notifications from the delta, so its
 * delivery is complete once claimed.
